# Contributing

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ¥³ ColorStack is nothing
without its community, and that certainly extends to the software that we build.
This is a big team effort!

## Deciding What to Work On

You can start by browsing through our list of
[issues](https://github.com/colorstackorg/colorstack/issues) or creating your
own issue that would improve our product. Once you've decided on an issue, leave
a comment and wait to get approval from one of our codebase admins - this helps
avoid multiple people working on this same issue.

## Making a Pull Request

Some things to keep in mind when making a pull request:

- The target branch in our repository is `main`.
- Fill out the PR template accordingly.
- The name of the PR should:
  - Start with one of the following prefixes:
    - `feat`: A non-breaking change which adds functionality.
    - `fix`: A non-breaking change which fixes an issue.
    - `refactor`: A change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    - `docs`: A change only to in-code or markdown documentation.
    - `test`: A change that adds missing tests.
    - `chore`: A change that is likely none of the above.
  - Be present tense (ie: "Fix", not "Fixed").
  - Start with a verb (ie: "Fix ....", "Add ...", "Implement ...").
  - Have an emoji at the end of it (we like color around here). ðŸ”¥
- Each PR should be attached to an issue, so be sure to add this to the PR
  description:
  ```
  Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>.
  ```
  See more about
  [linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- A PR can only be merged (by a maintainer) if:
  - A maintainer has reviewed and approved it.
  - All CI checks have passed. See [this](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow
    for more details.
  - All branches are up to date before merging.
  - All conversations are resolved.

## Local Development

To get started with local development, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have the following software on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (v20.x)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) (v1)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v15.x)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/)

### Fork and Clone Repository

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
   the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
   the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/oyster.git
   ```
3. Create a new branch.
   ```
   git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
   ```
4. Install all project dependencies.

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

### Environment Variables

Set up your environment variable files by duplicating `.env.example` to `.env`
in a few places:

- `/apps/admin-dashboard/.env.example`
- `/apps/api/.env.example`
- `/apps/member-profile/.env.example`
- `/packages/core/.env.example`

You'll notice that a lot of environment variables are empty. Most of these empty
variables are tied to the 3rd party integrations we have with platforms such as
Postmark for sending emails and Google for authentication. If you would like to
enable these integrations in development, please see the
[How to Enable Integrations](./docs/how-to-enable-integrations.md)
documentation.

### Database Setup

You'll need to make sure that Postgres and Redis are running in the background.

#### Postgres Setup

Once Postgres is running, you can connect to it by running:

```sh
psql
```

You'll then need to create 2 Postgres databases locally named `colorstack` and
`colorstack-test`. Within the `psql` terminal, run:

```postgresql
CREATE DATABASE colorstack;
CREATE DATABASE colorstack-test;
```

You should now be able to connect to each database like this:

```sh
psql colorstack
```

#### Executing Database Migrations

To execute the database migrations, run:

```sh
yarn db:migrate
```

To verify that the migration was executed successfully, connect to your Postgres
database and run:

```sh
\d
```

You should see a bunch of SQL tables!

#### Seeding the Database

Now that we have some tables, we're ready to add some seed data in our database,
which will enable you to log into the Admin Dashboard and Member Profile. Run:

```sh
yarn workspace @colorstack/core db:seed
```

Follow the prompt to add your email, and you will now be able to log into both
applications.

### Building the Project

You can build the project by running:

```sh
yarn build
```

### Running the Applications

To run all of our _packages and applications_, you can run:

```sh
yarn dev
```

To run all of our _applications_, you can run:

```sh
yarn dev:apps
```

To run a _specific package or application_, you can use the `--filter` flag like
this:

```sh
yarn dev --filter=api
```

### Editor Setup

Surprise, surprise. We use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to
write code! After you download it, we'll need to enable some extensions to make
life a bit easier:

- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Tailwind IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- [Typescript Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pmneo.tsimporter)
